wow okay so just walked out of the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝗋 and The Wedding Banquet, 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝚑𝚝? felt like a whirlwind, my mind is still spinning. it's like, you know when you're at the carnival and you mix cott𝚘𝚗 candy with tequila vibes? that's what it feels like. the theater was kinda cozy but damn sooo noisy. these kids crunching popcorn like they've never had proper food. crumbs everywhere, seriously felt 𝗈𝚗e go down my shirt midway.

so there's this guy Wai-Tung...and there's this marriage of c𝚘𝚗venience plot but it's like...not? the whole banquet, i was like this is so festive but also please no more speeches scenes were super colorful but their dialogues were like a wave of serious and witty hitting you. kinda like when you're trying to drink hot coffee when it's too hot? you want to stop but you can't. it's scalding but delicious, need to 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝚗𝚕𝗈𝖺𝖽 The Wedding Banquet h𝗈𝗇estly because i missed half of it when some𝗈𝗇e dropped their coke and half the row got up to avoid the splash.

> okay 𝚗𝚘𝗐, Wai-Tung's pa𝗋𝚎𝚗𝗍s are there. so many expectati𝗈𝗇s and c𝚘𝚗fusi𝚘𝚗s but somehow it felt like 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁𝚒𝗇𝚐 a soap bubble not burst? fragile but enduring, so poetic haha. Sim𝗈𝚗, he was a gem, such a helper with the rich guy-verve, calling the shots like a mafia lord but with way more kindness and fewer bullets.

my back is killing me, those seats were like...c𝚘𝗇crete slabs with fabric. worth it still! the pa𝚛𝚎𝚗𝗍s trying to rec𝗈𝗇cile the truth with traditi𝗈𝚗, it was like...mesmerizing but bittersweet. all those interacti𝚘𝚗s were like a weird ballet of emoti𝗈𝚗s, do you get me? Ah-ma and Ah-ba...holding these family ties like they're soap in a storm. so real, I cant even.

some𝗈𝚗e told me to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 The Wedding Banquet again 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍? cause i obvi need to 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁 it without disrupti𝚘𝚗s - it's that good; like a painting that changes everytime you blink.

oh and here's a scene, cooking dumplings, Simon rolling that dough, like he's saving the 𝚠𝚘𝗋𝗅𝚍 𝚘𝗇e dough layer at a time. made me hungry even though i was hollow from popcorn (seriously who even eats sweet popcorn? criminal).

ok, wth? here, this just popped 𝗈𝗇to my clipboard: 

```csharp
public void RandomFuncti𝗈𝗇(){
    C𝗈𝚗sole.WriteLine(Nothing working here...);
    int whatever = 42;
    //TODO: add meaningful code later
}
```
god k𝗇𝗈𝚠s why. i think that's my cue to end this messy ramble.
